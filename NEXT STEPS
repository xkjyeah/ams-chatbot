What you want to get done:

1. Given a Telegram message [DONE]
2. Fetch the current state of the chat the conversation came from
3. Hand it over to the state transition function
4. Fetch any number of other states
5. Modify the states
6. Emit the responsesbu
7. Return the new state

Guidelines:
- Don't bother too much with threading Futures -- most of it will be blocking anyway (Telegram API,
    fetching the initial state)
- Besides, flatMapping futures is really hard to understand

Problems you might find interesting:
- Serialize / deserialize BSON <> Case Classes -- you need this to
    serialize your state!
- Some kind of ODM to fetch your state
